# business-product-API
I used the website sheety for storing data that the user entered. this project contain the library of os, request and datetime

        hidden_token = os.environ.get("SECRET_AUTH_TOKEN")

        headers = {
            "Authorization": hidden_token

        }
  
By the way you cannot access my API, you need to have a authorization token to access it. if you want to tho just request me
